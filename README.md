####Libraries:
**Body Parser**
body-parser module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.

**DotEnv**

**Express File Upload**
Simple express middleware for uploading files.

**Express Handlebars**
A Handlebars view engine for Express which doesn't suck.

**Multer**
Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.

**MYSQL**
This is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.

**MYSQL2**
MySQL client for Node.js with focus on performance. Supports prepared statements, non-utf8 encodings, binary log protocol, compression, ssl much more

**Nodemon**
nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

**Path**

 ####New Tech:
 #####Chosen.js

 Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.

#####hover.css
The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).
